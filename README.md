# Create a New Knowledge Module
This repository is meant to serve as a general template for how to set up new knowledge modules.

## Requirements
Each module is currently set up using a Markdown file which must include a title and then any additional information you wish to add. 

See `example.md` as an example for how the file must be formatted. 

## Privacy Settings 
Modules can either be public (i.e., seen and used by anyone who has the link to your Github Markdown file) or private (i.e., seen and used only by you and selected collaborators). To create a private module, set the Github repository that your Markdown file is located in to be **private**. 

## Adding a Module to Knoll
To add a module to your Knoll extension, navigate to the [Create Page](https://knollapp.com/create). Then, you can input the title of your module and the URL to the `.md` file that you have created. 

## Example Modules 
We provide below a list of sample modules that are popular. You can also browse the [Explore Page](https://knollapp.com/explore) for inspiration.
