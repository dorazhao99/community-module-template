# Create a New Knowledge Module
This repository is meant to serve as a general template for how to set up new knowledge modules.

## Requirements
Each module is currently set up using a Markdown file which must include a title and then any additional information you wish to add. 

See `example.md` as an example for how the file must be formatted. 

## Privacy Settings 
Modules can either be public (i.e., seen and used by anyone who has the link to your Github Markdown file) or private (i.e., seen and used only by you and selected collaborators). To create a private module, set the Github repository that your Markdown file is located in to be **private**. 

## Adding a Module to Knoll
To add a module to your Knoll extension, click the + button on the upper left corner of the browser extension. Then, you can input the URL to the `.md` file that you have created. 

If you want to share your extension with the community, you can click the checkbox that says "I want to share this module with the Knoll community." Once the module has been approved, it will be featured on the Explore page for other users. 

## Example Modules 
We provide below a list of sample modules that are popular. You can also browse the [Explore Page](https://knollapp.com/explore) for inspiration.
